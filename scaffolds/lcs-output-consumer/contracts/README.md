# Contract Sync Placeholder

Copy contract assets from an LCS release package (`lcs-contracts-vX.Y.Z.zip`) into this repository:

- `contracts/index.json`
- `schemas/*.schema.json`
- `docs/contract/*.md`
- `fixtures/contracts/*.json`

If you bootstrap from the LCS core repo using `scripts/scaffold_output_consumer.py --with-contracts`, these files are copied automatically.
