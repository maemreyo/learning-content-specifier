## Workflow Summary

LCS provides a hard-gated command chain for spec-driven learning content:

`charter -> define -> refine -> design -> sequence -> rubric -> audit -> author -> issueize`

Artifacts are generated under `specs/<###-slug>/` with markdown + json contracts and local-first outputs in `outputs/manifest.json`.
