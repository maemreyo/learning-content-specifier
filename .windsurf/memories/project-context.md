# LCS Project Context Memory

## Project Overview
Learning Content Specifier (LCS) is a comprehensive toolkit for implementing Spec-Driven Development (SDD) - a methodology that emphasizes creating clear specifications before implementation. The toolkit includes templates, scripts, and workflows that guide development teams through a structured approach to building software.

## Key Components
- **LCS CLI**: Command-line interface that bootstraps projects with the LCS framework
- **Templates**: Reusable templates for different AI agents and development workflows
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts for common development tasks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and documentation

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Package Manager**: Poetry (pyproject.toml)
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Linting**: flake8, black
- **Documentation**: MkDocs
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Project Structure
- `src/lcs_cli/`: Main CLI application code
- `templates/`: AI agent templates and command files
- `tests/`: Test suite
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `scripts/`: Build and utility scripts

## Current State
- **Status**: Forked and cleaned for personal development
- **Base Tag**: fork-start
- **Next Version**: v1.0.0 (first stable release)
- **Branches**: main, integrate, dev (clean setup)

## Development Philosophy
- Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology
- AI-first development workflows
- Multi-agent support (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.)
- Quality-focused with automated testing and linting
