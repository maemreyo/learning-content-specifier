# [PROJECT_NAME] Learning Content Charter

## Core Principles

### I. Outcome-First Design (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All learning units MUST start from measurable learning outcomes before content drafting begins.

### II. Objective-Activity-Assessment Alignment
Every declared outcome MUST map to instructional activity and assessment evidence.

### III. Accessibility and Readability by Default
Content MUST satisfy agreed accessibility baseline and audience-appropriate readability.

### IV. Evidence-Driven Quality Gates
Rubric and audit checks are mandatory gates before authoring final outputs.

### V. Local-First Output Contract
All generated assets MUST be packaged in repository-local output structures for downstream consumers.

## Standards & Constraints

- Course/Module/Lesson structure is required unless a documented exception is approved.
- Each unit MUST include metadata for ownership, version, duration, modality, and audience.
- Breaking schema changes require explicit version bump and migration notes.

## Workflow Governance

- Required program command flow: `/lcs.charter -> /lcs.define -> /lcs.refine -> /lcs.design -> /lcs.sequence -> /lcs.rubric -> /lcs.audit -> /lcs.author`
- Subject governance updates use: `/lcs.subject.charter`
- Skipping rubric or audit is prohibited in hard-gate mode.
- Amendments to this charter require rationale and impact summary.

## Governance

This charter supersedes local practices for learning-content development in this repository.
